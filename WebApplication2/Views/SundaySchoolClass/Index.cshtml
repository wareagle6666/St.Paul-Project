                                <li>
                                    To educate our children spiritually and morally in true Christian Education, in accordance with the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ and the faith and traditions of the Coptic Orthodox Church

                                    To develop in our children the habit of attending church regularly, studying the bible, and participating conscientiously in the worship and mysteries of our church
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    To cultivate in our children an Orthodox conscience and devotion to our principles, and to prepare them so that they become faithful and devoted dynamic members of our church, our community, and our country
                                </li>

                            <p class="event-details__bottom-text-1">Each Sunday School class follows a teaching structure which consists of a prayer, a hymn lesson and a Sunday School lesson—all driven from curricula posted on the Servants Portal.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <strong> Prayer Curriculum: </strong>Students will learn Agpeya prayers and psalms every year, so that by the time they finish high school they will have memorized a number of them.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Hymns Curriculum:</strong> The curriculum has a defined list of hymns and a timeline for teaching the hymns throughout the year.

                        </div>
                        <p class="sectionheaders"> Prayer Curriculum</p>
                        <p>Memorization of church prayers is fundamental for the spiritual growth of every Orthodox Christian. Therefore, the Sunday School Service takes the initiative of teaching the Agpeya prayers from the very early stage to the last stage of Sunday School. Each class (grade level) is provided with a defined Prayer Curriculum. This curriculum remains the same every year for that grade level; it does not change. At the beginning of the Sunday School class, each class is to commence with the prayer until the children memorize the prayer, and then the class should move on to the next prayer on its curriculum.</p>

The curriculum has a defined list of hymns and a timeline for teaching the hymns throughout the year.
